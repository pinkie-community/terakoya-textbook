# Claude Code Context: AI寺子屋教科書システム

## Project Overview
Street-level AI literacy education system targeting Japanese IT beginners who primarily use paper-based workflows and basic PC applications (Word/Excel). Focus on addressing job security fears while providing practical AI skills.

## Target Audience Personas
**田中さん (55歳・経理事務)**: Excel proficient, prints for verification, 20 years manual bookkeeping
**佐藤さん (42歳・小売店経営)**: Notebook-based management, PC intimidation, handwritten customer lists  
**鈴木さん (38歳・製造業管理職)**: Word documents, USB file transfer, cloud-averse, 3-hour report writing

## Tech Stack & Constraints
- **Content**: Markdown documentation, GitHub repository hosting
- **AI Tools**: Google Gemini (free tier), Google AI Studio
- **Community**: Discord server integration via GitHub URLs/QR codes
- **Platform**: PC-first with smartphone fallback options
- **Cost**: Free tools only, addresses economic concerns

## Key Design Principles
1. **Empathy-First**: Every module validated against persona-specific anxiety checklist
2. **Success Experience**: "私でもできた!" moments within first 15 minutes of each module
3. **Practical Business Value**: Real scenarios (経理, 商品説明, 報告書作成) not theoretical examples  
4. **Dual-Layer Learning**: README.md (curriculum) + system-prompt.md (AI tutoring)
5. **Community Support**: Discord integration for peer learning and question assistance

## Workshop Integration
- **Duration**: 90 minutes total, 35 minutes realistic for setup (validated via testing)
- **Real Experience Data**: Discord installation most problematic (16min avg), QR codes work for smartphones, PC users need direct GitHub URLs
- **Success Metrics**: >90% setup completion, confidence increase >3 points, >60% continued usage at 30 days
- **Delivery Materials**: Complete facilitator training system with emergency protocols
- **Setup Bottleneck Solution**: 3-phase approach (Google+Gemini essential, Discord best-effort, individual follow-up)

## Development Status & Implementation Lessons
✅ **Phase 0**: Research completed - technical stack decisions, persona analysis
✅ **Phase 1**: Design documents completed - contracts, data model, quickstart validated
✅ **Phase 2**: Task planning completed - 40 tasks executed with educational TDD approach
✅ **Phase 3**: Module content completed - all 6 modules with empathy validation (100% pass rate)
✅ **Phase 3.6**: Workshop integration completed - full delivery system with real-world testing
✅ **Phase 3.7**: Content polish completed - templates, troubleshooting, community guidelines

## Key Implementation Insights
- **Educational TDD Approach**: Empathy validation before content creation proved essential
- **30-minute Setup Challenge**: Realistic testing revealed 35min needed with 3-phase approach  
- **Discord Complexity**: Most problematic step requiring dedicated support materials
- **Persona Validation Success**: 32/32 empathy items achieved 100% coverage
- **Template System**: Business scenario templates critical for practical application
- **Community-Centric Design**: Ongoing support via Discord essential for retention

## Constitutional Adaptations  
Educational content project requires adapting standard software development practices:
- **Libraries→Modules**: Reusable learning components with defined interfaces
- **CLI→AI Interface**: system-prompt.md enables conversational learning assistance  
- **Testing→Validation**: Workshop feedback & empathy checklist verification
- **Version Control**: Collaborative content improvement via GitHub

## Common Collaboration Patterns
- **Module Development**: Always validate against 3 persona empathy checklists BEFORE content creation
- **Instructional Writing**: Use simple Japanese, avoid technical jargon, provide concrete business examples for 田中さん・佐藤さん・鈴木さん
- **Flow Testing**: Assume 35-minute setup (not 30), plan for smartphone + PC compatibility with fallback options
- **Content Updates**: Maintain dual-layer structure (README + system-prompt) + static/templates for practical exercises
- **Workshop Delivery**: Use complete facilitation materials with minute-by-minute guidance and emergency protocols
- **Community Management**: Implement 3-tier moderation (proactive support, reactive response, individual escalation)

## Critical Success Factors  
⚠️ **Address job displacement anxiety explicitly** - show AI as work enhancement, not replacement
⚠️ **Provide immediate practical value** - real business scenarios within 15 minutes  
⚠️ **Maintain accessibility** - assume low technical confidence, use encouraging language
⚠️ **Enable peer support** - Discord community integration essential for ongoing learning
